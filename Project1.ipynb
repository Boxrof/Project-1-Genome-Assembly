    "In this project, we will explore genome assemblyâ€”the process of determining the order of nucleotides in DNA from fragmented reads. As you might have studied in the reading assignments, genome assembly can get quite complicated, as problems such as full sequence coverage, finding a good length for reads (the $k$ in $k$-mer), and sequencing errors present challenges for sequencing analysis and accuracy. You can assume perfect coverage for all parts of the assignment and no read errors for the first two questions.\n",
