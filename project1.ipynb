We do hope all students will at least attempt this and that more ambitious students will work hard to solve it and learn interesting things by the attempt (whether or not it is successful), but not get frustrated if you can't get to the desired answer.  As a \"Challenge Problem\" it means that you shouldn't be worried if you are not able to solve this, though, and you can get full expected credit on this assignment without answering it.\n",
